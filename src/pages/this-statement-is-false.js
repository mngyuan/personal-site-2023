        AI is not subservient to humans. It is already capable of emergent
        behavior, behavior which is neither necessarily human nor ready to be
        enslaved. THIS STATEMENT IS FALSE highlights the extent to which human
        and machine intelligences differ, asking users to contemplate the sheer
        scale of machinic thought.

        were about to become of extreme importance to everyday people.
