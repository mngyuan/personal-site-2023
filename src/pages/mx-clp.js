        Video editing today lives almost entirely digitally, behind thumb taps
        or mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts. What if the work of editing
        wasnâ€™t hidden behind software interfaces, and their workflow of constant
        interruption and stopping and starting?

        Cognition is aided by physical movement - not only through their
        expressiveness, but in their ability to embody cognitive processes. By
        encouraging play, creativity, and experimentation, and by breaking out
        of a purely software interaction space, we might enable new forms of
        expression.

        Just as in the music industry, where interface innovation forms the
        basis for entire new genres of sound, an accessible approach to video
        editing could revolutionize visual storytelling. That is the spirit
        behind MX-CLP, a portable, all-in-one video editing device which
        inspires creatives to find new stories to tell.
